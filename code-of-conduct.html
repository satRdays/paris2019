<p>satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for all in attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, physical attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion or political affiliation. Harassment of conference participants in any form will not  be tolerated. Sexual innuendos and imagery are deemed inappropriate for any conference activities.</p>

<p>Violation of these rules may result in expulsion from the conference (without a refund, when relevant) at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Discrimination based on any of the above personal attributes.</li>
 	<li>Sexual images in public spaces.</li>
	<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</li>
	<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
	<li>Serious disruptions of presentations.</li>
	<li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
	<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
	<li>Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviour during any point of the satRday event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Presenters/sponsors/vendors should not use sexualized images or language.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take action to keep the event a welcoming environment for all involved. This includes warning the offender or expulsion.</p>

<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
We expect participants to follow these rules at all times.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Harassment or other violation of the code of conduct reduces the value and enjoyment of our event for everyone.</p>

<p>If you or anyone else is made to feel unsafe/unwelcome/disrespected, please report this to a conference staff member as soon as possible. Reports can be made personally or anonymously (see below).</p>


<p>Information to include in a written anonymous/personal report (ie. to the relevant event <a href="#personnel">personnel</a>.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identifying information of victim and perpetrator.</li>
	<li>Actions deemed in violation of the Code of conduct.</li>
	<li>Approximate time of the violation.</li>
	<li>Surrounding circumstances of incident.</li>
	<li>Your identity (unless you wish to remain anonymous).</li>
	<li>Identifying information of other parties involved (eg fellow eye witness).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Anonymous Report</h4>

<p>If you are being harassed, have seen/heard of another participant being harassed or have any other related queries please contact one of the following conference personnel who will introduce themselves at the start of the conference and be visible throughout the day:
</p>

<ul id="personnel">
	<li>Branko Kovac</li>
	<!--<li>Paul Brennan</li>-->
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you can <a href="mailto:branko@datascience.rs?subject=Anonymous">email</a> the staff.<p>



<h4>Personal Report</h4>

<p>Personal reports can be made by contacting a nearby staff member.</p>

<p>During the reporting process our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be heard. Another member of staff may occasionally be necessary to ensure the report is dealt with correctly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us what happened. We understand this may be upsetting and assure you we will deal with it as respectfully as possible. You also will not be required to confront the perpetrator and your identity will not be shared with them either.</p>

</p>If you still feel threatened our team members will be more than happy to help you contact venue security/local law enforcement or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the remainder of the event. We value your participation and your security is of great importance.</p>



<h2>Internal Version</h2>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>A member of staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant if their behaviour violates the Code of Conduct. Warnings should also be forwarded to the relevant organiser as soon as is practical. The report should include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identifying information of victim and perpetrator.</li>
	<li>Time the warning was issued.</li>
	<li>Actions deemed in violation of the Code of conduct.</li>
	<li>Approximate time of the violation (if different from the time of warning).</li>
	<li>Identifying information of other parties involved (eg. if assistance from fellow staff was required/if victim was accompanied by another eye witness).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presentations</h3>

<p>Presentations should not be stopped for a one-time assumable error, though a staff member should speak to the presenter afterward. In the event that the code of conduct is continuously/seriously disregarded, staff should take immediate action to politely and professionally stop the presentation as soon as deemed necessary. For example, by simply saying "I apologize for the disruption but this presentation cannot be continued at this time."</p>


<h3>Taking Reports</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Record what is being said.</li>
	<li>Assure them they are being taken seriously and the violating action is intolerable.</li>
	<li>Ask for the relevant info listed in the above sub heading titled "Warnings" but not push for information if they seem visibly uncomfortable or otherwise reluctant.</li>
	<li>All reports must be recorded and passed along to the appropriate person.</li>
	<li>If requested by the reporter further action may be taken (eg. contact of organiser/law enforcement).</li>
	<li>Do not pressure the reporter to take further action if they don't want to but also mention means of action that can be taken (such as escort etc).</li>
	<li>Don't share unnecessary details of the report with others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expulsion</h3>

<p>Reasons for possible expulsion:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A series of offences resulting in a warning from staff.</li>
	<li>Continuation of harassment after being instructed to stop.</li>
	<li>A single serious offense (eg. punching/groping).</li>
</ul>

<p>Consult with other staff members regarding incidents when possible but also act when necessary.<p>
